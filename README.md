This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and was pair programmed with Jonny Hakimian. It is a complex form that renders conditionally dependent upon user input, with one fetch that sends all input to a Heroku database. This project was deployed via Netlify and is hosted [here](www.ucglendersurvery.com) (Please do not submit any data into this database as it is being used by a RE capital firm!)
