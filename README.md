This freelance project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and was pair programmed with Jonny Hakimian. It is a complex form that renders conditionally dependent upon user input, with one fetch that sends all data to a Heroku database. This project was deployed via Netlify.
